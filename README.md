# **Exploratory Data Analysis - Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**
Day 3 of 100 Days of Exploratory Data Analysis

## **Content**
This breast cancer dataset was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.

Features are computed from a digitised image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## **Features:**
1. Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2.  Texture (standard deviation of grey-scale values)
3. Perimeter
4. Area
5.  Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6. Compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
7. Concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8. Concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9. Symmetry
10. Fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)


## **Target**
 - Diagnosis
